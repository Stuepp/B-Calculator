# Welcome to B-Calculator app 👋

Hi, I made this simple app to help a bit my father who deals with sales and must go through the Central Bank to get the value of the productus from their "original" coin, and then convert it to the one we use in the county + to know how much is going to make with a certain transaction.

I was going to publish this app on the Play Store, but kinda short on money to create my Google Developer Account...

I do plan on improving this app just a bit more, but is going to remain as a simple calculator.

! It is important to know that the value of the money, besides BRL, is the price of SALE, all the conversion goes to BRL, usign BRL as base.

This is an [Expo](https://expo.dev) project created with [`create-expo-app`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/create-expo-app).

You can clone this repos through the link (https://github.com/Stuepp/B-Calculator.git).

## Get started

1. Install dependencies

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

2. Start the app

   ```bash
   npx expo start
   ```

In the output, you'll find options to open the app in a

- [development build](https://docs.expo.dev/develop/development-builds/introduction/)
- [Android emulator](https://docs.expo.dev/workflow/android-studio-emulator/)
- [iOS simulator](https://docs.expo.dev/workflow/ios-simulator/)
- [Expo Go](https://expo.dev/go), a limited sandbox for trying out app development with Expo

You can start developing by editing the files inside the **app** directory. This project uses [file-based routing](https://docs.expo.dev/router/introduction).
